# BitFinex Challenge

The solution assumes only one cryptocurrency is used and assumes it is BTC. Need to change if needs to handled for multiple cryptocurrencies or any other cryptocurrency.

Also testing is not handled for implemented functions because of time constraints.

The solution may run out of memory or CPU for huge volume of inputs. Need to use DB for performance.

Also tested with only one client.

## Pre-requisites

1. Node v20 or above
2. Grenache nodes running at default ports.

## Install

Run `npm install` to install dependencies
